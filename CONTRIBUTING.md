# Contributing to BashMate
We welcome and appreciate your contributions to the BashMate project! Whether you're adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving the existing functionality, your involvement helps make BashMate better for everyone.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.

## Submitting Changes

1. Make your changes and ensure that the code follows the existing style and conventions.
2. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and don't break any existing functionality.
3. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. Push your branch to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main BashMate repository.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits specification for our commit messages. This helps maintain a consistent and readable commit history. Please structure your commit messages as follows:

<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
The <type> should be one of the following:

    • feat: A new feature
    • fix: A bug fix
    • docs: Documentation changes
    • style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
    • refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    • perf: A code change that improves performance
    • test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
    • chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
    • The [optional scope] can provide additional context about the changes, such as the component or area of the codebase affected.

The <description> should be a concise summary of the changes, written in the imperative mood (e.g., "add new feature", "fix bug", "update documentation").

The [optional body] can provide more detailed information about the changes, such as the motivation behind the changes or an explanation of the approach taken.

The [optional footer(s)] can be used to reference related issues or pull requests, or to provide other relevant information.

Here's an example of a well-formatted commit message:

feat(git): add new git-update command

Introduce a new git-update command that fetches and pulls the latest changes
from the main and workflow branches, and applies any pending migrations.

## Code Style
Please ensure that your code follows the existing style and conventions used throughout the BashMate project. This helps maintain a consistent and readable codebase.

## Testing
Make sure to thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected and don't break any existing functionality. If your changes introduce new features or fix bugs, consider adding relevant test cases as well.

## Documentation
If your changes affect the usage or configuration of BashMate, please update the relevant sections of the README.md file to reflect the changes.
